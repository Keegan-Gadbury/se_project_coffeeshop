# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- I would like to make a login page, where customers can mobile order their coffee, save their favorite drinks, and share them with friends!
